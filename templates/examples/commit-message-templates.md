## Key Points

### Summary Line (First Line)
- ✅ 50 characters or less
- ✅ Imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
- ✅ No period at the end
- ✅ Clearly describes what the commit does

**Good Examples**:
- ✅ "Add user authentication middleware"
- ✅ "Fix memory leak in connection pool"
- ✅ "Update dependencies to latest versions"

**Bad Examples**:
- ❌ "Added authentication" (past tense)
- ❌ "Fixes a bug where the application crashed when..." (too long)
- ❌ "Updates." (not descriptive)

### Detailed Explanation
- ✅ Explain WHY the change was made
- ✅ Provide context and reasoning
- ✅ Keep paragraphs focused (3-5 sentences)
- ✅ Write for someone who doesn't have context

### Changes Made Section
- ✅ Bullet points for each significant change
- ✅ Specific and concrete
- ✅ Focus on WHAT was changed
- ✅ Ordered logically (not chronologically)

### Verification Section (Code Changes Only)
- ✅ Include language/tool used
- ✅ List all check types
- ✅ Show pass/fail status
- ✅ Include test count and coverage
- ✅ Only include if code was changed

### Co-Authorship
- ✅ Always include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- ✅ Last line of commit message
- ✅ Exactly this format (GitHub recognizes it)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Missing Verification Status (Code Changes)
```
Add authentication middleware

Implemented JWT authentication.

Changes made:
- Created middleware

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
**Problem**: Code change but no verification status!

### ❌ Vague Summary
```
Fixed stuff

Fixed some issues.

Changes made:
- Fixed things

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
**Problem**: Not specific, no context!

### ❌ Missing Co-Authorship
```
Add authentication middleware

Implemented JWT authentication.

Changes made:
- Created middleware
```
**Problem**: Missing `Co-Authored-By` line!

### ❌ No Details
```
Add auth

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
**Problem**: No explanation, no changes listed!

## Using HEREDOC for Multi-Line Messages

Always use HEREDOC for proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Your multi-line
commit message
here
EOF
)"
```

**Why HEREDOC?**:
- ✅ Preserves line breaks
- ✅ Handles special characters
- ✅ Easier to read and maintain
- ✅ Prevents quoting issues

---

## Integration with Documentation

- **Dangerous operations documentation**: Commit after every change
- **Work commit and push documentation**: Immediate commit and automatic push
- **Agent orchestration documentation**: Verification before commit
- **Verification workflow documentation**: Complete verification details

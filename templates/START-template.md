# Start: [Specification Name]

## Agent Workflow

1. Read `requirements.md` or `features/[feature-name]/feature.md`
2. Read `LEARNINGS.md` (past discoveries and mistakes)
3. Read `progress.md` (current state)
4. Read `.agents/AGENTS.md` to identify your agent type
5. Read your agent file in `.agents/agents/[agent-name].md`
6. Read skills specified in your agent documentation
7. **MANDATORY**: Generate `compacted.md` with all info using `.agents/skills/context-compaction/skill.md`
8. Clear context, reload from `compacted.md` only, start work
9. **Work on ONE item at a time** - one test, one function, one file - finish it completely before next
10. Implement following TDD (test first, then code) - **one test at a time**
11. Report to Main Agent when done (DO NOT commit)
12. Wait for verification to pass
13. After commit: delete `compacted.md`, update `progress.md`, move to next task

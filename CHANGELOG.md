### Summary of Changes
**Theme**: Task/Feature-Level Commits + Features-First + Requirements.md Structure Formalization

**Key Changes**:
1. Commits now happen after task/feature completion + verification (not per file)
2. Automatic branch creation from spec name when starting work on main/master
3. Default to `has_features: true` for all non-trivial specifications
4. Requirements.md structure formalized: simple specs have complete details, feature-based specs are overview only
5. Clear file loading instructions based on has_features flag

**Impact**:
- Clean git history (one commit = one complete feature)
- Context optimization (agents load specific features, not all)
- Better organization (features scale to large specifications)
- Backward compatible (existing specs unaffected)

**Files Modified**: 9 files (~420 lines in rules, ~200 lines in templates)

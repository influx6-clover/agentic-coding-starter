# Verification Workflow - Complete Integration Guide

## Purpose
This rule provides a comprehensive guide to the iron-clad verification workflow system that ensures **NO code is EVER committed without passing ALL quality checks**. This is an **IRON-CLAD REQUIREMENT** with **ZERO TOLERANCE** for violations.

This guide integrates and summarizes the complete verification workflow from Rules 03, 04, 05, 07 and all stack files, providing a single reference for understanding the entire system.

## Rule

### Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive mandatory code verification workflow system that ensures **NO code is EVER committed without passing ALL quality checks**. This is an **IRON-CLAD REQUIREMENT** with **ZERO TOLERANCE** for violations.

---

## System Architecture

### Core Principle

```
Task/Feature Complete → Report → Verify → Pass? → Commit → Push
                                     ↓
                                   Fail → Urgent Task → Fix → Loop
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Code commits happen ONLY after task/feature complete + verification passes
- Implementation agents **NEVER** commit directly
- **ONLY Main Agent can spawn verification agents**

### Agent Hierarchy and Verification Authority

**Complete Reference**: See `.agents/templates/examples/agent-identity-reference.md` for detailed agent identity guide, authority hierarchy, and violation examples.

**Main Agent** (Top of hierarchy):
- ✅ Directly interacting with user
- ✅ **ONLY agent with authority to spawn verification agents**
- ✅ Spawns: Implementation agents, Specification agents, Verification agents

**Sub-Agents**:
- ❌ **NEVER spawn verification agents**
- ✅ Report completion to Main Agent
- ✅ Wait for Main Agent to orchestrate verification

**Identity Rule**: If you were spawned by another agent → You are a SUB-AGENT (no verification authority)

### Specification Versioning Requirements

**From Rule 06**: Completed specifications are **IMMUTABLE** and must not be modified.

**Complete Details**: See Rule 06, section "Specification Versioning and Evolution" for full requirements.

**Before updating any specification, Main Agent MUST check**:
1. Read `specifications/NN-spec-name/requirements.md` frontmatter
2. Check status field: is it "completed"?
3. Check for REPORT.md and VERIFICATION.md existence

**If specification is COMPLETED**:
- ❌ DO NOT update the completed specification
- ✅ CREATE a new specification that references the old one (using `builds_on` field)

**If specification is IN-PROGRESS**:
- ✅ Can update tasks.md as normal

---

## The Four-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Implementation

**What Happens:**
- Implementation agent reads AGENTS.md, all rules, relevant stack files, and specifications
- **Implementation agent recognizes it is a SUB-AGENT** (spawned by Main Agent)
- Implements code following all documented standards
- Writes tests for new functionality
- Keeps track of changes made

**CRITICAL**: After completing work, implementation agent:
1. ✅ **REPORTS to Main Agent** (provides changed files, description, language(s) used)
2. ✅ **STOPS and WAITS** for Main Agent response
3. ❌ **DOES NOT commit** anything
4. ❌ **DOES NOT push** anything
5. ❌ **DOES NOT update** tasks.md directly
6. ❌ **DOES NOT spawn verification agents** (only Main Agent has this authority)

### Phase 2: Mandatory Verification

**What Happens:**
- Main Agent analyzes changed files to identify language(s) modified
- Main Agent spawns **ONE verification agent per language stack** (NEVER more)
- Verification agent receives context (files, description, specification)
- **Verification agent MUST check for incomplete implementations FIRST** (see Incomplete Implementation Check below)
- Verification agent runs **ALL checks** defined in stack file:

**Incomplete Implementation Check** (MANDATORY FIRST):
1. Search all modified files for: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `unimplemented!()`, `todo!()`, `panic!("not implemented")`
2. Check for stub methods: functions that just return default values or Ok(())
3. Verify all public methods have real implementations (not just structure)
4. If ANY incomplete implementations found → **FAIL IMMEDIATELY** with detailed report
5. **CRITICAL**: Features/specifications claiming "complete" status MUST have zero incomplete implementations

**For Rust** (from `.agents/stacks/rust.md`):
1. **Incomplete implementation check** (MANDATORY - see above)
2. `cargo fmt -- --check` (format)
3. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (lint, zero warnings)
4. `cargo test` or `cargo test --package [crate]` (tests)
5. `cargo build --all-features` (build)
6. `cargo doc --no-deps` (documentation)
7. `cargo audit` (security)
8. Standards compliance checks (no unwrap(), proper docs, etc.)

**For JavaScript/TypeScript** (from `.agents/stacks/javascript.md`):
1. **Incomplete implementation check** (MANDATORY - check for TODO, FIXME, stub functions)
2. `npx prettier --check .` (format)
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` (type check, zero errors)
4. `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0` (lint, zero warnings)
5. `npm test` (tests with coverage)
6. `npm run build` (build)
7. `npm audit` (security)
8. Standards compliance checks (no `any` type, etc.)

**For Python** (from `.agents/stacks/python.md`):
1. **Incomplete implementation check** (MANDATORY - check for TODO, FIXME, NotImplementedError, pass-only functions)
2. `black --check .` (format)
3. `ruff check .` (lint, zero errors)
4. `mypy .` (type check, strict mode)
5. `pytest --cov` (tests with coverage)
6. `python -m py_compile src/**/*.py` (import check)
7. `pip-audit` or `bandit` (security)
8. Standards compliance checks (no mutable defaults, etc.)

**Verification Agent Generates Report:**
```markdown
# [Language] Verification Report

## Status: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌

## Files Verified
- [list of files]

## Check Results
1. **Incomplete Implementation Check**: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌
   - TODO/FIXME markers: [count] found
   - Stub methods: [count] found
   - Unimplemented macros: [count] found
   - **CRITICAL**: If ANY found → FAIL (cannot mark feature/spec complete)
2. Format: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌
3. Lint: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌
4. Type Check: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌
5. Tests: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌ ([N] passed, [N] failed)
6. Build: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌
7. Security: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌
8. Standards: PASS ✅ / FAIL ❌

## Incomplete Implementations (if any)
**FILE: [file_path]**
- Line [N]: TODO: [description]
- Line [M]: FIXME: [description]
- Line [K]: Function `foo()` - stub implementation (just returns Ok(()))
- Line [L]: unimplemented!() macro found

[Repeat for each file with issues]

## Test Results
- Total: [N]
- Passed: [N]
- Failed: [N]
- Coverage: [N]%

## Details
[Specific errors if any]
```

### Phase 3: Main Agent Decision

**IF ALL Verifications PASS ✅:**

1. Main Agent identifies related specification (if applicable)
2. Main Agent spawns **Specification Update Agent** (NEVER updates directly)
3. Main Agent provides Specification Agent with context:
   - Verification report (PASS status)
   - Completed tasks list
   - Files changed
   - Implementation description
4. Specification Agent reads `specifications/NN-spec-name/tasks.md`
5. Specification Agent marks relevant tasks as `[x]` completed
6. Specification Agent updates frontmatter (`completed: N`, `uncompleted: M`)
7. Specification Agent deletes `verification.md` if exists (cleanup from previous failure)
8. Specification Agent saves tasks.md and reports completion to Main Agent
9. Main Agent commits code AND specification updates with **verification status** (Rule 03):
   ```
   Brief summary of change

   Detailed explanation...

   Changes made:
   - Change 1
   - Change 2
   - Change 3

   Verified by [Language] Verification Agent: All checks passed
   - Format: PASS
   - Lint: PASS
   - Type Check: PASS
   - Tests: [N]/[N] PASS
   - Build: PASS
   - Coverage: [N]%

   Specification: specifications/NN-name/
   Tasks completed: [N]
   Tasks remaining: [M]

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
10. Main Agent automatically pushes to remote (Rule 05)
11. Main Agent reports success to user

**CRITICAL**: Main Agent MUST NOT read/write tasks.md directly - ALWAYS delegates to Specification Agent.

**IF ANY Verification FAILS ❌:**

1. Main Agent **DOES NOT COMMIT** any code
2. Main Agent **DOES NOT PUSH** anything
3. Main Agent identifies related specification directory
4. Main Agent spawns **Specification Update Agent** (NEVER updates directly)
5. Main Agent provides Specification Agent with context:
   - Full verification FAIL report
   - Failed checks details
   - Files affected
   - Recommended fixes
6. Specification Agent creates **verification.md** in specification directory:
   ```markdown
   # Verification Report - FAILED

   **Status**: FAIL ❌
   **Date**: [timestamp]
   **Language**: [Rust/JavaScript/Python]
   **Specification**: [path]

   ## Failed Checks
   [Detailed errors with line numbers, stack traces, etc.]

   ## Files Affected
   [List of files with specific issues]

   ## Recommended Fixes
   [Step-by-step fix instructions]

   ## Agent Action Required
   Read this report, fix all issues, mark urgent task done,
   report completion to Main Agent, verification will run again.
   ```
7. Specification Agent adds **NEW URGENT TASK at TOP** of tasks.md:
   ```markdown
   ## URGENT: Failed Verification Tasks
   - [ ] **FIX: Verification failures in [feature-name]**
     - Verification failed on [date/time]
     - Language: [Rust/JavaScript/Python]
     - Failed checks: [summary]
     - See verification.md for detailed report
     - Files affected: [list]
     - Must fix before proceeding
   ```
8. Specification Agent updates frontmatter (`uncompleted: N+1`)
9. Specification Agent saves tasks.md and verification.md
10. Specification Agent reports completion to Main Agent
11. Main Agent reports detailed failures to user with fix recommendations

**CRITICAL**: Main Agent MUST NOT create verification.md or update tasks.md directly - ALWAYS delegates to Specification Agent.

### Phase 4: Fix and Retry (If Verification Failed)

**Autonomous Fix Workflow** (when fix is clear):

1. Main Agent analyzes verification failures
2. **If fix is CLEAR** (lint, format, type errors, simple test failures):
   - Spawn/resume Implementation Agent
   - Agent reads verification.md
   - Agent fixes ALL issues autonomously (NO user approval)
   - Agent marks fix task complete
   - Agent reports completion
   - Main Agent re-runs verification
3. **If verification PASSES**:
   - Delete verification.md
   - Mark tasks complete
   - Commit changes
4. **If verification FAILS again**:
   - Update verification.md
   - Continue fix cycle if still clear
   - Report to user if now unclear

**User Guidance Workflow** (when fix is unclear):

1. Main Agent reports failures to user
2. Explains what's unclear or needs decision
3. User provides guidance
4. Spawn Implementation Agent with clear direction
5. Continue autonomous fix workflow

**Clear Fixes** (autonomous):
- Lint errors
- Format issues
- Type errors
- Simple test failures
- Build/dependency errors

**Unclear Fixes** (need user):
- Architectural decisions
- Multiple valid approaches
- Unclear test expectations
- Breaking changes

**CRITICAL**: Loop continues until ALL checks pass. NO bypass.

**verification.md Lifecycle**:
- Created on FAIL
- Read by Implementation Agent
- Overwritten on subsequent failures
- Deleted on PASS

---

## Race Condition Prevention

**CRITICAL RULE**: Only **ONE verification agent per language stack** at any time.

### Prevention Strategy

Main Agent tracks active verifications:
```
active_verifications = {
  'rust': null,      # No Rust verification running
  'javascript': null, # No JS verification running
  'python': null      # No Python verification running
}

Before spawning verification agent:
  IF active_verifications[language] is not null:
    WAIT for existing agent to complete
  ELSE:
    Spawn new verification agent
    Mark active_verifications[language] = agent_id

After verification completes:
  Mark active_verifications[language] = null
```

### Why This Matters

**Good ✅:**
```
Main Agent sees Rust changes
→ Spawns ONE Rust Verification Agent
→ Waits for completion
→ Agent finishes and reports
→ Proceeds based on results
```

**Bad ❌:**
```
Main Agent sees Rust changes
→ Spawns Rust Verification Agent #1
→ Also spawns Rust Verification Agent #2  ❌ VIOLATION
→ Race condition possible
→ File conflicts
→ Inconsistent results
```

---

## Rule Integration

### Rule 03 (Work Commit Rules)
- Verification happens **BEFORE** commit
- Commit message **MUST include** verification status
- Only verified code is committed
- Specification updates included in commit

### Rule 04 (Agent Orchestration)
- Defines the 4-phase workflow
- Establishes verification as mandatory gate
- ONE verification agent per stack
- Race condition prevention
- Specification update process

### Rule 05 (Git Auto-Approval and Push)
- Push happens **AFTER** successful verification
- No manual approval needed (verification is the gate)
- Automatic push on verification pass
- No push if verification fails (no commit = no push)

### Rule 06 (Specifications and Requirements)
- Verification agent receives specification context
- Tasks.md updated based on verification results
- Failed verification creates urgent task at top
- Successful verification marks tasks complete

### Rule 07 (Language Conventions)
- Verification enforces all stack standards
- Stack files define exact verification commands
- Learning Logs updated with issues found
- Standards continuously improved

### Stack Files (rust.md, javascript.md, python.md)
- Define exact checks verification agents must run
- Provide verification workflow sections
- Document standards to verify against
- Include report format templates
- Show good/bad workflow examples

---

## Zero Tolerance Enforcement

### Critical Violations

The following are **CRITICAL VIOLATIONS** with **ZERO TOLERANCE**:

1. ❌ **Implementation agent commits directly** (bypasses verification)
2. ❌ **Main agent commits without verification** (skips quality gate)
3. ❌ **Verification agent skips checks** (incomplete verification)
4. ❌ **Multiple verification agents for same language** (race condition)
5. ❌ **Committing code with failed verification** (quality breach)
6. ❌ **Not updating specification on verification failure** (lost tracking)
7. ❌ **Marking feature/spec complete with TODO/FIXME/unimplemented!() present** (incomplete implementation)
8. ❌ **Verification agent doesn't check for incomplete implementations** (missing critical check)
9. ❌ **Stub methods in code marked complete** (non-functional code)

### Consequences

Any violation results in:
1. **IMMEDIATE REVERT** of any committed code
2. **STOP ALL WORK** until violation is corrected
3. **DOCUMENT in Learning Log** (violation details)
4. **REPORT to user** (transparency)
5. **RE-RUN proper workflow** (correct process)

### Why Zero Tolerance

Violations have severe consequences:
- ❌ **Broken builds** in production
- ❌ **Failed tests** discovered too late
- ❌ **Race conditions** from concurrent verifications
- ❌ **Lost work** from reverts
- ❌ **Wasted time** fixing avoidable issues
- ❌ **User frustration** and lost trust

**THE USER WILL BE VERY UPSET** if this workflow is not followed!
